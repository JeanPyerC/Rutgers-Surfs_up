# Rutgers - Surfs Up

## Overview of the analysis:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this project is to explore the power of advanced data storage and the efficiency of transforming and filtering certain data. The goal is to analyze the temperture trend in Oahu, Hawaii. To create a short summary of temperture data between the months of June and December in order to determine if a prospective surf and ine cream shop business can operate year-round. 

## Results:
- Summary Statistics DataFrame: June Temperatures

## Summary:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally speaking, the tempertures recorded in both months are the same. By revieing the graphs, you can see that both tempertures rest between 70 & 75 degrees. Overall the average tempertaure is 75 degrees with the max being 85 degress in June and 83 degrees in December. We have enough data to move forward with the Surf and Ice Cream Shop idea based on this information. However, I would look into other important data points such as the type of weather we will often see, as well as the average wave torrent, and the location of the business.
